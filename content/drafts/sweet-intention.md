It makes sense. That pretty much sums up what we're all always trying to do. In some way shape or form we're trying to make life more wonderful. Not always just for ourselves, but also for others, because having others in our life makes our own life more valuable. Life is a good as a multiplayer game



We tell jokes, we compliment, and we cry out loud because they are all windows inside of ourselves and we want to share ourselves with someone out there. And they want what we have to share because life is more fun for them with you too.

If someone says something to you, and it doesn't sound like a gift, then you missed it.

That doesn't mean it's your fault. Communication is a tricky thing. It's not always easy to discern what someone means by their words or actions.

There are ways to tell though. If there's a misunderstanding inside a trusting relationship, both parties can assume that the other person means no harm.

Likewise if someone is hurt and they say something to you that sounds hurtful.



Rosenburg teaches us that since what we really mean is to be playing the "make life more wonderful" game, even when we've forgotten, that we can safely assume that whatever someone says, no matter how it sounds, is really meant as a gift. Like gift of information, like what's hurting inside of me and what I'm needing.
