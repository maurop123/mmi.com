Keep to the simple. In thoughts and desires

Make your plans simple. Your desires easily satisfied. And you will have the power to make whatever reality

Let go of the specifics, the details, but hold on to the sweet intention from which the plan came. You'll find it in your heart

Hell is being stuck in a tight loop

Like repeating the same mistake,

Over and over...

Awakening is like learning how to fly. You run and jump faster and faster, falling each time, until you reach escape velocity
