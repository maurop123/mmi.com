# Disposable Identities

Just getting up to go for a jog. Feeling really tired this morning.

I watched a parkour video on reddit and it got me sad for a bit. It seems that some old things that I've been away from for a while are soft spots. Maybe it's regrets or something.

Identity is a funny thing. So many of us are so used to getting so attached to our identities, which are most useful because they are disposable. Just go somewhere where no one knows you and you can be anyone. Isn't that so freeing? You don't gotta be the same stuck schmuck for a bit, you know?

[Alan Watts said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TftiXXi_mY) that the word "person" comes from Latin word "persona". Per Sona = From Sound. This was the name of the mask the actors in a play wore because it is from where the sound of the characters would come out on stage. Stanislav Grof talks about this too in [The Cosmic Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dswm2eCb-WE) which basically is one of those characters the Greeks used in their plays [fact check]. It's a mask we where. A construct. Not real in and of itself. Just a trick with which we fool everyone around us and get lost into ourselves.

I really am becoming a new person and many people close to me are telling me that. Just many of my old patterns of behavior are vanishing, the most notable being that I'm getting down a lot less than before.

But still, even as I'm constructing a new character for myself, when I revisit old interests or relationships, I am suddenly overwhelmed by the wave of sadness that washes over me. I used to feel bad all the time about the things I didn't do. I stopped doing parkour. I stopped spoken word too. I stopped talking to many friends and many family too. It's as if all those things are wrapped up tightly in ideas of what I "should" have done and the regret of the "fact" that I didn't. But what if that's not really how it is? 

What if the story isn't that I first didn't do what I should have and then I feel bad for it. What if instead it's that I felt bad first and then without realizing it went into the past to find "my mistake" that lead to my current suffering? Well that version is interesting because laid in it is the assumption that my suffering is my fault. I've unwittingly fallen into the Blame Game, again!

To be honest, that pattern of finding ways to blame myself for all my suffering sort of became like a knee jerk reaction for a lot of time, and one that I just fell for every time. It's now that I'm a little older and a tad wiser that I can smell the bullshit. This morning I think I hit a old subject, parkour, that is just still wrapped up in that old worldview. Watching that video just fired up all the circuitry that was still connected to the subject. Like flipping the switch on a christmas tree, the "I suck" show just lit up.

But it's cool. I'm a lot more patient now and I don't just fall for those stories anymore. Instead I sit and write until I arrive to something that makes a little more sense, which I have, so my work here is done.
