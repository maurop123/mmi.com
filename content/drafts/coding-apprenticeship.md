# Coding Apprentice Wanted

Seeking interested candidates for **Marienbad Coding Apprenticeship**

You will be learning what it takes to be a modern fullstack web developer, confidently able to go for that *remote tech job*.

I'll teach you about making modern Progressive Web Apps with Vue.js (frontend), and Node.js microservices powered by AWS Lambda (backend).

I'll also share hard-won development wisdom for working smarter instead of harder, all the while adding value to the work you do.

If any of that sounds interesting to you, please email me at [maurop123@gmail.com](mailto:maurop123@gmail.com)

Thanks!
