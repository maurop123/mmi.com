# Mobile-First Design

As the name would suggest, mobile-first design is about starting with the mobile design of a page, and then updating the design as the page grows wider.

Since mobiles became so widely used, but most sites were still being design first (and only) with desktop view in mind, someone asked, "Hey! Why don't we make sites look good on mobile first?"

It caught on! Mobile designs are easier to start with since elements mostly just stack on each other.
