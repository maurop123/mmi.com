# Easy Button

## Roadmap

### V1 (developing)

Installation will just be...

- Vue app that the user can add to their app
- Then they gotta add `#easy-button` id somewhere in their html.

This should...

- add a button that opens a dialog when clicked
- send the user an easy-link, which will take them to the first page of the flow.

Done!


### V2 (planning)

Ideas for widget - it should...

- show the plans available to the dealer
- be able to update the plans as the users update their plans without requiring the module be reinstalled
