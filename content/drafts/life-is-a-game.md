Recently I talked to a couple friends about what I believe in. What life is and why we're here. Here it is in a nutshell.


## Life Is A Game

What is a game? [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game) says...

> A game is a structured form of play...

The word "play" implies **players** who play the game, and the "structure" can be thought of as the **rules** of the game. So a game is essentially a set of players and rules.

So what's the point of the game? s with any game, your goal is to be a good player. So playing with others well and understanding the rules well.


## How It Relates To Personality Type Theory

Of course, no one is born knowing how to be a good player. You just wake up as a helpless infant and go figuring it out as best you can. You gotta learn how to treat others and how to read the situation. But you don't need to know how to do both perfectly to play the game. Many times with just knowing either one well enough for the challenge at hand you can move on to the next challenge.

Imagine you're an infant who is hungry. Depending on what's available to you in the moment you may try one thing or another. If your mother is nearby, you might just cry and let her figure it out. If she's not there but left the bowl of pudding in front of you, you might try your luck figuring out how to work the spoon. In the first case you learn how to play with another player, in the second how the rules of eating work.

Now picture the same dilemma, you're hungry, but this time you have your mother nearby and the food bowl in front of you. Which strategy are you going to try? Hint: You also have your experience! That is, if you got fed before by crying out to mommy, then you're more likely to try that or similarly reaching out to her again. If it works, you get more experience in that skill of working with others and are more likely to use it again too. If instead, you fed yourself before, then you're likely gonna try that out again and keep figuring out how this whole "feeding yourself" game works.

This is the same way many development psychologists believe we develop our personalities from an early age. To start, there are 4 cognitive functions, or mental skills, in Jung's theory, 2 of which are **Feeling** and **Thinking**.

So the baby that works with the mother is developing the Feeling skill. The one who's figuring out how things work is building up the Thinking skill. This happens as naturally as we learn to favor our right or left hand over the other. By being faced with situations in which we must use our right or left hand, we make our choice, it works or it doesn't, and we take that experience with us for next time. Then our **accumulated advantage** with one hand turns into a preference, which is exactly what personality types are. Our tendency to prefer to do things one way over another consistently over time, which accumulates our skill in that way of playing the game.


## Why A Game?

Recent research on games overwhelmingly reports that games are just so awesome in so many ways. They help us train our minds, connect more with others, and inspire us like movies and books. With games we've been able to solve a 15 year old AIDs protein structure problem in 10 days (Foldit), and gamification every day motivates people to learn more, like picking up a new language (Duolingo) or a meditation habit (Headspace).

In general, we learn best through play. Not just humans, but all animals. Something about having a safe space to try out new things just let's us level up so much faster.

## The Point Is To Level Up

So if life is a game, and games are just great for leveling up, then perhaps the point of life is primarily to learn and grow. Not to be happy go-lucky all the time, but to struggle and have fun at the same time.


## Movies and shows about this idea

I didn't come up with this idea all on my own. I'm not even the first to think of it. I'm just figuring it out myself.

[The Game](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119174) is a pretty good movie that fully plays out this idea.

Tom Campbell, author of the [My Big Toe]() series, also says that life is like a game of World of Warcraft. A big MMO generated for the players by the players to help them grow.

You also may have heard life called other things than a game, like a [stage by Shakespeare](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/56966/speech-all-the-worlds-a-stage).

[The Good Place]() also seems to play out this idea, at least that's my theory since I'm only 4 episodes in, but they don't call it a game. Instead they're a little more direct and liken it to the afterlife.

It's not an old idea and in fact it's pretty popular. Some smart kids like to call it [Simulation Theory](), you know like the Matrix and Truman Show.
