# Sentree Smart ACs

![sentree homepage](/imgs/sentree-homepage.jpg)

Sentree, brought to you through a partnership of Alert Labs and Watsco, is an IoT device that attaches to AC systems, allowing them to report their own vitals to the cloud for further processing, and on an app that helps technicians know what's happening before they even leave the office.

Sentree reports on an AC's vapor temperature, liquid pressure, current, and more metrics important for any AC tech job. The app then reports back those base metrics on the app.

Sentree will even try to diagnose the root cause behind any anomalies it picks up. The more Sentree works, the smarter it gets, and the safer your AC becomes.

Now Sentree can tell home owners how much they're spending and how much they could be saving based on how much much their system actually runs. This new insight can help owners save energy and save money better than ever before.

Sentree has been a very fun project to work on. Helping to make ACs smarter is not something I ever saw myself doing, but having been raised in South Florida, it's an easy pain point to empathize with. As a solution, Sentree offers value all-around for businesses, home owners, and the environment. It upgrades the technician's arsenal with an app that with a powerful tool that giving them the data that previously they would only get by being on-site.
