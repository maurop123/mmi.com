# Navigate Miami

![navigate miami](/imgs/navigate-miami.png)

[Navigate Miami](http://navigate.miami) is a project made in collaboration with the Miami Dade Beacon Council, Watsco Ventures, and Code For Miami. For this project, we made a map of Miami's tech scene.

Built chiefly with Vue and Leafly, this [open souce](https://github.com/maurop123/navigate-miami-map) project organizes 8 different categories of Miami's entrepreneurial ecosystem including accelerators, coworking spaces, and funding organizations, making it easier to navigate the neighborhood.

The app includes an easy-to-use editor built with Vuetify and backed by Firebase. Simple and to the point, this app is one of my favorite examples of the Vue + Vuetify + Firebase stack that makes web app fast and easy to make.
