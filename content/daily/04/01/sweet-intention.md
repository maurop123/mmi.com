# Life is a Game

Marshall Rosenburg says that there is only one game that we are all playing at all times, even when it doesn't seem like it, and that is "how do we make life more wonderful?"

Funny how it doesn't seem like it a lot of the time. When people are yelling at one another, it certainly sounds like they've forgotten all about the game, and they have, that's why they suck at it at that moment. But the game goes on, and it's up to everyone to figure out how to make life more wonderful.

Life is a multiplayer game. A *real mmo*. We can do a lot by ourselves, but we can do more together, and life is more fun with others

Once of the reasons, says Alan Watts, is that others can surprise us. We don't have full control over them and so they aren't completely predictable. He reminds us that in chess, when checkmate is certain, the game is restarted, because there is no fun in playing a game with a certain outcome.

The same is true in dominoes. You call the game if you've got certain victory.

Like any good game, there are challenges in the game of life, and thus not all moments are so wonderful. We can complain about them if we want, but it doesn't do us any good to get stuck there, or to give up on the game. The game doesn't stop! And if you're not playing to make life more wonderful, then you're letting it suck more and more

You see, life can't be awesome by itself. You may have heard of entropy. The rule that says that without effort, everything tends to chaos. Did you know that fear is an entropic force? Like all forms of resistance, its essential function is to hit the brakes on some course of action or flow of life. Temporarily tensing in fear can help to avoid danger or stand pain, but we aren't meant to get stuck there and many of us do. Many of us learn to endure a lot of prolonged pain and we become "traumatized", stuck in fight-or-flight mode. All growth stagnates

Losing sight of the game is big problem. Whenever I forget, I am confused and lack confidence to do anything. I try to remind myself that there is a game, and thus whatever difficulty I am facing must simply be one of the challenges I am meant to face and somehow overcome. It's taking a "gameful approach to life", as Jane McGonigal might call it.



Rosenburg teaches us that since what we really mean is to be playing the "make life more wonderful" game, even when we've forgotten, that we can safely assume that whatever someone says, no matter how it sounds, is really meant as a gift. Like gift of information, like what's hurting inside of me and what I'm needing.


It makes sense. That pretty much sums up what we're all always trying to do. In some way shape or form we're trying to make life more wonderful. Not always just for ourselves, but also for others, because having others in our life makes our own life more valuable. Life is a good as a multiplayer game



We tell jokes, we compliment, and we cry out loud because they are all windows inside of ourselves and we want to share ourselves with someone out there. And they want what we have to share because life is more fun for them with you too.

If someone says something to you, and it doesn't sound like a gift, then you missed it.

That doesn't mean it's your fault. Communication is a tricky thing. It's not always easy to discern what someone means by their words or actions.

There are ways to tell though. If there's a misunderstanding inside a trusting relationship, both parties can assume that the other person means no harm.

Likewise if someone is hurt and they say something to you that sounds hurtful.
