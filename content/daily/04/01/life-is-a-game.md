Marshall Rosenburg, creator of Nonviolent Communication, says that there is only one game that we are all playing at all times, even when it doesn't seem like it, and that is "how do we make life more wonderful?" Funny how it usually doesn't seem like it.

When people are yelling at one another, it certainly sounds like they've forgotten all about the game, and they have, that's why they suck at it at that moment. But the game goes on, and it's up to everyone to figure out how to make life more wonderful.

Life is a multiplayer game. A *real mmo*. We can do a lot by ourselves, but we can do a lot more together. One of the reasons, says Alan Watts, is that we don't have full control over them, and so they can surprise us. Nothing is more boring than what is totally predictable. Alan reminds us that in chess, when checkmate is certain, the game is restarted, because there is no fun in playing a game with a certain outcome.

The same is true in dominoes. You call the game if you've got certain victory.

Like any good game, there are challenges in the game of life, and thus not all moments are so wonderful. We can complain about them if we want, but it doesn't do us any good to get stuck there, or to give up on the game. The game doesn't stop! And if you're not playing to make life more wonderful, then you're letting it suck more and more

You see, life can't be awesome by itself. You may have heard of entropy. The rule that says that without effort, everything tends to chaos. If we don't try to make life wonderful, it will start to suck, and not just for us, but for those around us, and it just keeps getting worse till we wake the fuck up! HA HA HA!!!

Losing sight of the game is big problem. Whenever I forget, I am confused and lack confidence to do anything. I try to remind myself that there is a game, and thus whatever difficulty I am facing must simply be one of the challenges I am meant to face and somehow overcome. It's taking a "gameful approach to life", as Jane McGonigal might call it. In her book, Super Better, she has a lot of great ways to see life as a game.

Life is a game that gets better the more people that are playing. It's up to us to recruit! Let's wake up our friends who have forgotten about the game, so that they can play again! Like they say, the more the merrier =)
