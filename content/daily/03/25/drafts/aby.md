Just smoked purple

My father killed himself. These are my thoughts on suicide

First and foremost, it's your life. So ultimately it's up to you. And though people will try to convince you that it isn't, they never can, and you know it, because there is very little anyone can do to stop you.

That is a strange power to have. Afterall, there is so much we have such little control over. What we get sick with, who will love us, and even our names. Of course we could take control of any such aspect if we put our minds to it, but killing yourself is something you have to try to NOT do.

Lets try to think of a few things you have to try to not do

- to get mad
- to smoke and drink
- drive off a cliff

Those are all still ways of killing ourselves. Suicide is just getting to the point in a way. Isn't it?

Morbid. I know. I promise, it won't get any better. If this isn't your cup of tea, now would be a good time to move on.

I won't ever do it, if that's what you're wondering. My dad already beat me to it. Those are two things I will never do because my dad did them first. Suicide, and my mother.

There are bright sides, but I'm not there yet

Now we like to act like there is no other way of killing yourself other than in a violent and sudden way. But that's bullshit. There are a ton of ways to kill yourself! Let's think of a few

- signing up for war
- unhealthy habits
- drug abuse

We just like to draw lines when the only difference between any of them is how much help we have.

You know, when you sit and compare, ODing on heroine doesn't sound like such a bad way to go

Actually the thing that really pisses me off is that people even say it's wrong as if they can punish you for it. The guy skipped trial, remember? I guess they wanna pressure you out of it like they do for so many things.

I actually think suicide makes sense sometimes.

I didn't grow up with my dad. My parents split when I was 3, and my mom, sister, and i moved to my grandparents house. las casa de mis abuelos. Watch out! I'm busting out the Spanish!

El viejo, my grandad, died when I was 4, and then it was just Aby, my grandma, my mom (her daughter), sister and me for the next 5 years

My mom worked all the time so Aby and I spent a lot of time together. She'd listen to whatever kid stuff I had to say, pretend to be a damsel in distress when I wanted to play Batman, and of course, she'd always make me the best egg, ham, and cheese sandwiches.

That was a big deal since there was always fighting in my house. A lot between her and my mom, as you can imagine. And she always stood up for me when I couldn't defend myself, even with her weak knees.

And she was a fun person too. She was always bouncing to some music and laughing out loud, even if it was in someone's face. It was like at some point she realized she didn't have to put up people's bullshit and then remained free ever since. Sure she could be unruly, and sure that must've sucked to deal with (I rarely had to), but she couldn't help being a fierce and independent woman. Niether can my mom or sister.

You have to understand, I grew up with 3 fierce independent women. That's why I'm soft and sensitive. They taught me to be a gentle man.

They didn't need someone to open the door for them or even pick up the check. So I never tried. Instead I held my grandmother's hand whenever she cried.

Later, when she was in a home, I'd bike over a couple times a week just to spend time with her. She was so lonely in the home, but there was nothing we could do. We weren't prepared to handle someone with full blown dementia. My mother tried for a long time, lord knows she did, but it was just unsustainable. So we all agreed to put her in a home. And once she was there, little by little we stopped seeing her.

I visited her the most and it still wasn't more than a handful of times a year. It was hard to get myself to go each time, but once I was with her I really did enjoy myself with her a lot. She made an effort to make our time nice together

She might have been losing her mind, but she wasn't stupid. She knew that she was forgetting things and flat out remembering things that never happened. Everyone was telling her that all the time. I think that's why she liked spending time with me in the end. Cause I didn't care

She could ask me the same question 10 times in a row and most of the time I'd reply like it was the first time. I know for some it's too hard to be asked about that relative that died, and have to break the news each time over again. I just didn't care. All things considered, she was still a super nice person to be with.

She still bounced in her chair to whatever song was playing, and laugh out loud, and still sometimes in people's faces. Even those she was literally trapped in a medical facility just waiting to die, hopelessly lost in the Jenga tower of her mind, she still knew she was free be whoever she wanted to be in each and every moment.

How many of us take that freedom for ourselves? How many of us give up to stand up when feel we should because we're scared or tired? How many of us give in to the bullshit lives we're given, resigned to forever complain about it?

Aby did complain, and she did have trouble moving around, what with arthritis in both of her knees, for as long as I knew her, but she also traveled the world, made money and lost it, and she never stopped dancing or singing, not even in the home.

Fuck man. I really wish I had done more for her...

Inevitably, by the end of every visit, she would tear up and tell me how sad she was. Her spark would vanish. Her eyes would widen, her mouth would quiver, and she'd say, "Honey. I Want To Die."

For 10 years she told us that she wanted to die. For 10 years we tried to cheer her up, and she'd always say the same thing. "Ay que malo es llegar a ser viejo! Dis is my last year. Estoy cansada." I'm tired

And why shouldn't she be? Her knees stopped working in her 50s, her husband died in her 60s, and for 10 years she lived with her daughter, whom she fought with a whole lot, and finally the last 10 years with dementia in a home. She had Do Not Recessitate for those last 10 years but wasn't lucky enough to be blessed with a heart condition like her husband.

And then finally, she got sick and went into the hospital. And then hurricane Irene came thru, and somewhere between the different hospitals she was transferred to, she got really sick, and she didn't get any better.

I remember I was sitting with her in the hospital. It was one of the last times I talked with her as she was so sick she was hardly lucid anymore. Someone came and told me that we had to make a tough choice.

We had to decide, whether to keep giving her the treatment that was keeping her alive, or to stop it, take her to hospice, and let her die naturally. And I remember what my first thought was. Why didn't anyone tell us we had this option before?

Why did we have to get to the point where my grandmother couldn't choose for herself anymore to make the choice for her? If someone had told her 10 years before that she could stop taking her medicine and she could die like she wanted, would she? I think so. Maybe not at first, but by the 7th or 8th year, when she was really like, "Yo! I'm not kidding. I'm done with this shit." I think she would have done it. But no. She wasn't given that choice. Because we in that one way, she wasn't free. She knew she had permission to live, but she didn't know she had permission to die.
