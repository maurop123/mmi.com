# Palm Tree

Now I'm getting ready for another round of work. I'm at a totally different state than I was this morning, and I think that's OK.

This morning I was revved up and ready to get shit done. Now I'm relaxed and flexible, like a palm tree blowing in the wind. I have no desire to control things around me. On the contrary, I want to release any such control and accept what is.

Sometimes when I feel like this I get nervous. What if something overwhelming comes my way? What if I can't cope and don't get any work done? What if I fall behind? But I think I may be confused when I'm making those connections between being easy-going and getting tossed around. In fact, relaxing probably allows me to concentrate more of my energy into my roots, so I may stand very firm even against strong winds. Like the palm tree bending to the storm, but never breaking. There is **strength** in flexibility

So as I go into my work now, I want to remember that strong winds are OK. I can weather them. I can bend and still stand them. And what's more, I can thrive in them. Because in the storm I can do my alchemy. I can transform confusion into clarity. That is something I do. Harmonizing. And to do that work, I need discord to work with.

So let me do my work. Let me do my best with what I can. Let me stand firm through the strong winds, and when I am done, I'll step back and melt into the river. And the river will wash me downstream, and serve me up on a new shore, where untold adventures await =)
