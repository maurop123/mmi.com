# I am a new person

I am a good player. I know how to have fun. I can enjoy any game

I am a positive thinker. Always have been

I ask interesting questions. They lead me to interesting places

I am creative. I have good ideas, all the time

I am an explorer. I am unafraid to get lost. To discover

I am patient with myself. I enjoy playing the game. I want to learn. To get better at playing the game. To *be* the best player I can be!

The things that used to stress me, now intrique me. I see them more clearly

The challenges that used to get me down, now delight me. I see the game

I am resilient. When something doesn't go the way I expected, I pay attention. I listen. When I listen long enough, I learn things.

I am gentle. I am caring

I am a loving person. I am lovable

I am hard working, because I love what I do

I write about what I do because I am proud of it, I cherish it, and I want to share it

When I am tired, I relax. When I am relaxed, I play

I *am* paying attention. I am focused on the things that matter to me

I know what matters to me. I write and talk about it all the time

I know I get distracted. And when I do, I refocus. Or else, I relax

I am going to forget again. I will fall asleep. And that's OK. I am here now, and I will be here again soon

Awaken once, and you cannot remain asleep. What has been seen cannot be unseen

I am a poet, a writer, anything I need to be to say the things I have to say

I know I may seem weird to you, and I'm OK with that. I hope you are too =)

I am ready to learn. I am prepared for whatever may come. I am ready to have fun. I am ready to play
