# Poem - I am a new person

I am a good player. I know how to have fun. I can enjoy any game

I am a positive thinker. Always have been

I ask interesting questions. They lead me to interesting places

I like exploring. Discovering. I am unafraid to discover

I am gentle. I am caring

I am a loving person. I am lovable

I am creative. I have good ideas, all the time

The things that used to stress me now intrique me. I see them more clearly

The challenges that used to get me down, now delight me. I see the game

I am resilient. When something doesn't go the way I expected, I pay attention. I listen. When I listen long enough, I learn things.


I enjoy playing the game. I am patient with myself. I want to learn. To get better at playing the game. To be the best player I can be!

When I am tired, I relax. When I am relaxed, I play.

I know I get distracted. And when I do, I refocus, or else I relax.

I am a poet, a writer, anything to say the things I have to say.

I am paying attention. I am focused on the things the matter to me. I know what matters to me. I write and talk about it all the time.

I know I may seem weird to you, and I'm OK with that. I hope you are too =)
I am hard working, because I love what I do

I write about what I do because I am proud of it, I cherish it, and I want to share it

I am ready to play. I am ready to learn. I am prepared for whatever may come. I am ready to have fun. I am ready to play

The rules are there to help Ma Vinci, not to stop him. If he doesn't need them, he can go ahead without them

I use Vim because it's fun
