# Homemade Fruit & Nut Bars

Lara bars are like the perfect treat for me. Sweetened with dates instead of sugar, and with just a couple extra ingredients the possibilities are endless!

## How I made them

I used with this [recipe](https://detoxinista.com/date-energy-balls-vegan-paleo/) for reference.

Then to start, I got all the ingredients out.

- **Dates** (0.5 cup)
- **Walnuts** (6)
- Shredded Coconut (0.25 cup)
- Cocoa Powder (0.5 tbsp)

You only need the first 2 ingredients though.

Then I put the dates and shredded coconut in the food processor...

...and mixed them until the mixture was crumbly.

The recipe cautions to not to over process them, or else the mixture can get too greasy, but I don't know what they mean by that. Anyway, this is how it looked for me

Then I added the rest of the ingredients and processed!

Mmmm! Looks good, huh?

So the last time I followed this recipe I made the date balls, but they went to fast for me. Instead this time I wanted something packaged more like lara bars.

So I dumped the mixture out, and hand-pressed it into a few small heaps, and then one big heap.

Finally, I pressed that heap into a rectangle, cut up the separate bars, and wrapped each one with saran wrap. It looked something like this...
