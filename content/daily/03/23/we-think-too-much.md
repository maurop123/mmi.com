# We think too much

We get so much momentum going that it's hard to slow down. The trouble is you can't listen when you're thinking

Thinking is our basic passive process, while thinking, speaking, and doing all are dynamic processes. We can't be in a passive state and a dynamic state at the same time. They're mutually exclusive

Sure we can split our attention over multiple tasks simultaneously, but our attention suffers, by definition, and it's our attention we want to focus

Attention. Focus. Memory. Those three words appeared to me in a dream. I was sitting on the ground to meditate.

My left arm went up. Attention
My back straightened, I think. Focus
My left arm went up. Memory

I think it followed a *relaxed breath*

Anyway, we're thinking too much. And so we're not listening anymore. That's why we keep making the same mistakes over and over again. We're not paying attention!

And you know that's what hell is. A tightly wound loop that you can't get out of. Don't kid yourself into thinking you might dodge that hole after death, you're living it now. Jesus said heaven is here on Earth for a reason

It was hard for me to start making time for slowing down. I thought I couldn't, that I had not time to slow down. What I couldn't see while I thought that was that I was racing to an early grave

By ignoring my own care, I was bringing the finish line closer, which some might say is good! Cause then you'll be the first to finish the race! You'll win!! But when the race you're running is your own life, you'd rather treat it as a marathon.

Slowing down has turned things around. Making a habit to meditate has brought me more peace and stability in my everyday life. I've paused my talk therapy and started financial planning as I'm already seeing the returns with the few new systems I've already got in place. And I'm feeling a lot more confident than ever before. Something which Improv has helped out with no doubt ;-)
