# Things I Learned From Improv

So I just finished a 2.5 month *improv* course. Graduation was last Tuesday and it was great!

Why did I try improv? Why does anyone try improv? I've asked the people I met there, and this is what I heard

- to challenge my fear of being in front of large audiences
- to improve my conversation skills
- to learn to relax and have fun

Some had prior acting experience or interest, but otherwise these were the common themes

Recently a friend from class told me that he believed that improv makes you a better person, and hey, if it can help you learn to speak in front of large audiences, as well as in private conversations, all the while learning to relax and have fun, it sounds like he's got a point. But how does it it do it? Here are some of the things I learned while doing improv...

## Improv is a lot like a normal conversation

I don't think anyone ever explicitly said that improv is like having a conversation in class, nor a lot of things that I'll be saying, but I think any of them would agree. When you're on stage making up a scene with a teammate, you notice the same things working on stage as work in normal conversations, as well as the things that don'e work.

You take turns telling the story. You gotta listen to each other. It works better when you respond to what was just said instead of responding to a point from five minutes ago, especially when you're doing that all the time. Then it seems like you're not listening but just trying to get your ideas or jokes heard. That's deeply unsatisfying for any audience.

Also, paying attention is difficult but vitally important. If you're on a date and wanting to impress your date, you listen to every detail they say, you paint a picture with that information, and you stay on track with the moment to moment turns of the conversation. We do this because listening is sexy, and even if you never heard someone say it, you know it.

## Put yourself out there. Even if you're scared

It doesn't matter if you screw up or say something dumb. You might, but it doesn't matter, because honestly, no one wants to get hung up on the stupid things that are said. And if someone does make a habit of calling out every dumb thing they or others say, they'll likely have a hard time finding someone to talk with. No one likes dwelling on the dumb shit.

Everyone wants the interaction to succeed. Nobody more than the large audience that came out to be entertained. The audience wants to try to like you and to laugh at the dumb things you say and do because that's what they came out to do. They're not there to pick on all your faults. If anyone is nit picking, then they're clearly missing the point of the show.

Same thing in a conversation. We want our conversations to flow. We want  to feel heard and like we're adding value to someone else's life just by talking with them, and we want the same in return. People are willing to make an effort to forget the inconsistencies and focus on the interesting bits for the sake of a good experience.

## If you want to flow...

A lot of us don't trust ourselves. Maybe it's cause we grow up with people telling us we can't do things so we get used to stopping ourselves. It sucks, but if anything that's the one thing improv is designed to undo. Our incessant critic that gets in our way of being ourselves.

> Accept what comes into your head. Accept yourself for thinking it. And then go with it.

It may not seem obvious at first, but when we criticize something we think of saying, we're really calling ourselves into question. The inner critic is saying, "Hold on there! You can't just say that! What's wrong with you? That's obviously wrong!" Even if in not so many words, that's what happening. We don't trust ourselves, and so we get stuck all the time. We learn to play it safe and we forget to take any risks, for fear of being *wrong*.

In our graduation performance, a teammate made a joke against women and immediately boos erupted from the crowd. His scene partner said, "Dude, what's wrong with you?" To which he replied, "I'm a misogynistic asshole!" And that got a big laugh from the crowd. Not only that, but the scene kept using his bigoted character without losing any steam at all.

You know why he was able to say something "wrong" and it still worked out? Because the value and meaning of what we say and do isn't determined by the act itself, but by what comes afterwards. If he hadn't caught himself and kept making misogynistic jokes, then surely the scene and the audience would have soured, but if we can trust ourselves and our teammates to pick us up when we fall, then there's really very little chance for us to actually fail.

## If there's 4 people on stage, then you only gotta do 1/4 of the work

This lesson has been very helpful in discerning when to step out on stage, and when to leave room for someone else get a chance to play. It can be easy to get nervous when on stage or in a conversation and take over the show or never say anything due to the pressure we feel to perform, but when you realize that you're only every doing half the work or less, then it doesn't seem as bad.

A friend of mine recently told me that when a friend wants to hang out with her, but she doesn't feel up for doing half the work of entertaining, she invites more friends to meetup because then she has much less work to do. Brilliant. Sheer brilliance!

## Don't leave them hanging

I usually prefer to focus on positive suggestions that offer specific actions we can take rather than restrictions without clear alternatives, but this is one *don't* I like to keep in mind.

In conversation it can be easy to slip into a reverie as the other(s) talk their heart out, and sometimes we miss our cue to jump in when they're struggling to complete their point. Sure sometimes people are excitedly monologuing, but in general dialogues are the aim of a conversation.

## You're there to have fun

It took me most of the 2.5 months of the course before I finally realized that the main thing getting in my way on stage was my own sense of dread every time I went out there.

I remember it was in a free intro class I brought a friend to where I learned that lesson. A group of us had just completed a group scene when the instructor asked us how we felt just before starting. I said, "Dread." I remember he said, " Dread?! You should be feeling excited!" Everyone else agreed. That's when it hit me. I had forgotten that first and foremost I was there to have fun. Playing make believe with a group of friends was the name of the game, and we were there to play. What was there to dread?

I might have had an excuse in front of a large audience, but this was an free intro class mostly for people who had never tried improv before, and I had 2 months of practice under my belt. There was no excuse. I had simply forgotten what i was there for in the first place.

When I first decided to try improv, I was just starting to deal with my anxiety in therapy. I was so stuck and depressed that it was hard to ever get into the moment. I was stuck in my head giving knee-jerk excuses for why I couldn't do anything I wanted to do. Improv trained me to suspend that inner critic that was keeping me from living. 2.5 months later and I'm a new person. My closest friends say they see the change too. They say I seem less stuck and much more confident than before. It's true. I feel it too.

Improv may not be for everyone, but it has helped me and the friends I made along the way learn to loosen up, have a good time, and put on a good show while doing it. And we all agree, it's helped make us better people
